Error Detected
[Wrong Answer]

Error Explanation
[The function `check_number` is returning "Negative" for all inputs, which does not match the expected output of "Positive" for the input provided (5). This indicates that the logic in the function is incorrect.]

Cause
[The specific part of the code causing the error is inside the `check_number` function where it always returns "Negative" without checking if the number is positive or zero.]

Fix
[Add conditional checks to determine if the number is positive, negative, or zero, and return the appropriate string based on these conditions.]
