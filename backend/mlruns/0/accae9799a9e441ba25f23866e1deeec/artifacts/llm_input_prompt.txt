        You are a Python error analyst.

        PROBLEM:
        Title: Positive, Negative or Zero
        Description: Determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

        STUDENT CODE:
        def check_number(n):
    # Your code here
    return "Negative"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = int(input())
    print(check_number(num))

        "Errors":
        [{'test_name': 'test_visible_0.py', 'passed': False, 'is_hidden': False, 'error': 'Wrong Answer', 'expected': 'Positive', 'actual': 'Negative', 'input': '5'}]
        
        TASK:
        Explain the errors according to the testcases occurred for the question and also identify and explain any runtime or compile-time errors in the code. Focus only on explaining what the errors mean in simple terms.

        FORMAT (use exactly this format):

        Error Detected
        [Name of the error type]

        Error Explanation
        [2-3 sentences explaining what the error means in plain language]

        Cause
        [1-2 sentences identifying the specific part of code causing the error]
        
        Fix
        [Brief fix to correct the errors. Don't give the code, just give an idea.]
